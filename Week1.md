## What are objects?
Nothing magical, just easier to understand.  We think about the world in terms of objects.

Anything can be an object and that's part of the appeal.  Anything you want in a computer program can be modeled as an object.

We can do things to objects and we can get objects to do things we want.  How they do those things is only a concern to the person that invented the object type.

For example: if we have a dog object we can put it in the car, we can give it a bath.  We can tell it to sit or give it food but what happens to the food after it 
is eaten or how the brain tells the dog's body to sit is only matters to the specialists (vet, biologist).  These boundaries make working with computer programs much easier when we think of the pieces as separate objects.

Python is great language to learn about objects because everything in Python is an object.

So let's create our first object and run the program.  Let's make the number 3 object.  Every object in Python has a type of object, called a class, and a value.  To help us explore objects in Python we have a couple of commands that are very handy.  These commands are dir, type, and print.
## 'dir', 'type', 'print',
Not surprisingly these commands are also objects.  Objects that are commands, meaning that they can run code and do things, are called functions.  We'll talk more about this later but for now just know that in order to issue a command we just put parenthesis after the name of the function object.  If we need to give the function more instructions, we put those inside the parenthesis.  Let's find out the type for the object 3.  Type type(3) and press play.  So we can see that the number 3 is an int which stands for integer and just means whole number.  Let's see all the things we can do with the number 3.  Type dir(3) and press play.  Wow!  That's a lot!  Luckily we don't need to know all that.
