## What are objects?
Nothing magical, just easier to understand.  We think about the world in terms of objects.
Anything can be an object and that's part of the appeal.  Anything you want in a computer program can be modeled as an object.
We can do things to objects and we can get objects to do things we want.  How they do those things is only a concern to the person that invented the object type.
For example: if we have a dog object we can put it in the car, we can give it a bath.  We can tell it to sit or give it food but what happens to the food after it 
is eaten or how the brain tells the dog's body to sit is only matters to the specialists (vet, biologist).  These boundaries make working with computer programs much easier when 
we think of the pieces as separate objects..
Python is great language to learn about objects because everything in Python is an object.
